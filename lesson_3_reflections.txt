When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that, just in case something happens to your local work, you have a backup online that is safe and ready to go.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are duplications of repositories on github. 
Clones are duplications of repositories from github to local and between locals.
Branches are changes made within a repository but are separate versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can make sure you are fully up-to-date between versions of the code.
