When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that, just in case something happens to your local work, you have a backup online that is safe and ready to go.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are duplications of repositories on github. 
Clones are duplications of repositories from github to local and between locals.
Branches are changes made within a repository but are separate versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can make sure you are fully up-to-date between versions of the code.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

We would just share a computer and work in person. Collaboration and the speed of the project would definitely go faster as we can have
in-person discussions about what to do. The only problem is that meeting in-person is not always easily accessible and therefore it would be hard to always do.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

It's better to create a separate branch for changes because then if you make a mistake or do something wrong you do not risk the
integrity of the project as whole and you can easily just revert changes. It's also nice to know that any change you make won't affect the project
in a negative way. A good way to know when to make changes is when you are about to do some major change to the project (like add some new feature)
that has the potential of causing bugs that could damage the entirety of the project.
